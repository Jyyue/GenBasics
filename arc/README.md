# about what is in this folder

like a building, it works well all by itself.

the model dir, data dir, condig dir, script dir ...

## how acr is like

so far the model just works by it self, given batch data,
you can call .train_step to train the model by one step(if batch data is fit in)

All the model is written in pytorch lighting module.
